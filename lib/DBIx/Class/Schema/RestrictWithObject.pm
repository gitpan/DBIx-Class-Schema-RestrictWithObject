=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Schema::RestrictWithObject - Automatically restrict resultsets

=head1 SYNOPSYS

In your L<DBIx::Class::Schema> class:

    __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/Schema::RestrictWithObject/);

In the L<DBIx::Class> table class for your users:

    #let's pretend a user has_many notes, which are in ResultSet 'Notes'
    sub restrict_Notes_resultset {
      my $self = shift; #the User object
      my $unrestricted_rs = shift;

      #restrict the notes viewable to only those that belong to this user
      #this will, in effect make the following 2 equivalent
      # $user->notes $schema->resultset('Notes')
      return $self->related_resultset('notes');
    }

     #it could also be written like this
    sub restrict_Notes_resultset {
      my $self = shift; #the User object
      my $unrestricted_rs = shift;
      return $unrestricted_rs->search_rs( { user_id => $self->id } );
    }

Wherever you connect to your database

    my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect(...);
    my $user = $schema->resultset('User')->find( { id => $user_id } );
    $resticted_schema = $schema->restrict_with_object( $user, $optional_prefix);

In this example we used the User object as the restricting object, but please
note that the restricting object need not be a DBIC class, it can be any kind of
object that provides the adequate methods.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<DBIx::Class::Schema> component can be used to restrict all resultsets through
an appropriately-named method in a user-supplied object. This allows you to
automatically prevent data from being accessed, or automatically predefine options
and search clauses on a schema-wide basis. When used to limit data sets, it allows
simplified security by limiting any access to the data at the schema layer. Please
note however that this is not a silver bullet and without careful programming it is
still possible to expose unwanted data, so this should not be regarded as a
replacement for application level security.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 restrict_with_object $restricting_obj, $optional_prefix

Will restrict resultsets according to the methods available in $restricting_obj and
return a restricted copy of itself. ResultSets will be restricted if methods
in the form  of C<restrict_${ResultSource_Name}_resultset> are found in
$restricting_obj. If the optional prefix is included it will attempt to use
C<restrict_${prefix}_${ResultSource_Name}_resultset>, if that does not exist, it
will try again without the prefix, and if that's not available the resultset
will not be restricted.
